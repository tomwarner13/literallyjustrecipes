## Ingredients
- 2 cups tomato sauce (or one 14.5 oz can)
- 1 can (6 oz) of tomato paste
- 1/3 cup apple cider vinegar
- 1/4 cup real maple syrup
- 1/4 cup molasses
- 2 tablespoons worcestershire sauce
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon dijon mustard
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- hefty pinch salt
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 canned chipotle pepper in adobo sauce (not one can, 1 pepper)

## Instructions

1. Add the chipotle pepper, garlic, and apple cider vinegar to a blender; blend till smooth.
2. Add all ingredients to a medium saucepan, stir to combine. Cover, bring to a simmer, and simmer at low heat for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
3. Allow sauce to cool. Refrigerate in airtight container until serving.

\*This is a heavily improvisational recipe. No quantities of ingredients require any strict measuring, and everything can be added to taste if you (like me) are too lazy to measure things.
