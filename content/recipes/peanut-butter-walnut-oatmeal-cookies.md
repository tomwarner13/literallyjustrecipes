## Ingredients

- 1 cup shelled walnuts (halves or pieces)
- 1 1/2 cups spelt or whole wheat flour
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 cup (packed) dark brown sugar
- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 1 cup chunky peanut butter
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2 eggs
- 2 cups rolled oats (ideally, extra thiccc)
- kosher or flaky sea salt

## Instructions

1. Add walnuts to food processor and processor until very fine - almost buttery.
2. Add butter and both sugars to the bowl of a stand mixer with flat or paddle beater. Beat at low speed until combined, then increase speed and beat until fluffy (2-3 minutes).
3. Add walnuts, peanut butter, eggs, and vanilla, mix until combined.
4. Lower the speed so the flour doesn't fly out and blend in flour, baking soda, and salt until combined. Mix at high speed for about another minute.
5. Add oats, mix until combined.
6. Line a large, flat pan with parchment paper (for chilling, not for baking). Scoop the dough into ~2 tbsp balls and lay them out on the pan; they can be almost touching. Lightly dust with large-grain salt. Cover with plastic wrap. Chill in fridge for at least 3 hours, up to overnight.
7. When ready to bake, preheat oven to 375F.
8. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Arrange the cookies on the sheet, leaving about an inch of space between them. Bake until lightly golden and still soft; ~10 minutes. Remove immediately and transfer to cooling racks.
