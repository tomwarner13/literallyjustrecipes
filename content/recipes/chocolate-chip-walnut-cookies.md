## Ingredients

- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
- 3/4 cup + 1 tbsp granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup light brown sugar (packed)
- 2 large eggs
- 1 1/4 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/4 tsp lemon juice
- 2 1/4 cups all purpose flour
- 1/2 cup rolled oats or instant oatmeal
- 1 tsp baking soda
- pinch cinnamon
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 2/3 cups semi sweet chocolate chips
- 1 3/4 cups chopped walnuts

## Instructions

1. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper (if you do not have 2 large baking sheets, you'll have to bake in batches).
2. Cream butter and sugars together in a stand mixer until light and fluffy, scraping sides as needed.
3. Beat in the eggs, vanilla, and lemon juice until fully incorporated, scraping sides as needed.
4. Lower the speed so the flour doesn't fly out and blend in flour, oats, baking soda, cinammon, and salt until evenly mixed into a thick, sticky batter.
5. With a soft spatula, fold in chocolate chips and walnuts until evently distributed in the dough.
6. With a large ice cream scoop or cookie scoop, scoop out a rough (3-ish tbsp) hemisphere of dough at a time and place on parchment-paper-lined baking sheets, leaving about 3 inches between neighbors. Do not flatten or shape cookies; they will flatten out as they bake.
7. Cover the prepared cookie sheets with plastic wrap so the dough doesn't dry out, and chill in the fridge for at least an hour or up to overnight.
8. When ready to start baking, preheat oven to 300F.
9. Bake the cookie sheet(s) in oven until the cookies look just dry on top; they should still appear soft and underbaked. The bake will probably take 15-20 minutes but you want to start checking the cookie tops by 15 minutes at the latest. Remove immediately.
10. Allow to cool and set for at least 10 minutes on the hot, parchment-paper-covered cookie sheet after removing from oven.
11. When set, remove to a board or tray or other flat surface (not a rack). You can serve them immediately while still warm, or transfer to an airtight container to store. They will be delicious at any temperature, but to re-warm, you can microwave your cookie(s) for roughly 8 seconds.
