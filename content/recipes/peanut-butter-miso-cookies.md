## Ingredients

### Dough

- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 3/4 cup creamy peanut butter
- 3 tbsp white miso
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 1/4 cup white granulated sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 egg

### For Coating

- 1/4 cup granulated sugar or large-grain sugar (such as demarara)
- 3 tbsp sesame seeds

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside. Mix together the sugar and sesame seeds for coating in a plate or shallow bowl, set aside.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and baking soda.
3. Add the softened butter, peanut butter, and miso to a mixer bowl. With the paddle attachment, mix together until smooth.
4. Add brown sugar, white sugar, and vanilla to the mixer. Mix until smooth and creamy. Add in the egg and mix again until evenly incorporated.
5. Set the mixer to low and slowly pour in the flour mixture (so it doesn't fly out). Mix until evenly incorporated.
6. Remove the dough from the mixture and scoop and roll it into roughly 1-inch balls. Roll each ball in the sugar/sesame mix until roughly coated; place them on your parchment-paper covered baking sheets about 4 inches apart.
7. With a fork, flatten each ball in a criss-cross pattern until it forms a cookie shape on the baking sheet, about half an inch thick. 
8. Bake one sheet at a time. For each sheet, bake for 9-11 minutes, until edges are just slightly golden brown (the cookies will still be very soft). Remove from oven and allow to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack. Serve as soon as they are cool enough to eat, or store in an airtight container.
