## Ingredients

- 8 oz (1 bar) cream cheese, softened at room temperature
- 1 8 oz package sliced pepperoni [^1]
- 1 8 oz package premade crescent rolls, such as Pillsbury
- 1/4 cup sliced green onions

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375, or the temperature indicated in the crescent roll instructions.
2. Arrange the crescent rolls into their separate triangles, then slice each one into three smaller triangles. Lay out on a cookie sheet.
3. Dice the pepperoni into tiny pieces. In a large bowl, evenly mix pepperoni, cream cheese, and green onions. 
4. Add one small spoonful of the filling into the center of each crescent roll triangle. Wrap each roll around the filling and form into a ball. Spray the cookie sheet with cooking spray and space each ball evenly on the cookie sheet.
5. Bake around 12 minutes, or the time indicated on the crescent roll instructions, until dough is golden brown on the outside. Serve warm.

[^1]: Substitute 8 oz cooked chorizo crumbles for the pepperoni for Southwest Texas Trailer Park Balls.
