## Ingredients

- 2 large leeks, white and light-green parts only, rinsed, halved, and thickly sliced
- 1 large bok choy, rinsed and thickly sliced
- 1/2 cup water
- cooking spray
- 2 tbsp unsalted butter, divided
- pinch salt
- 4 5-oz salmon fillets
- 2 tsp grated fresh ginger, divided
- 2 tsp soy sauce
- 1 1/2 tbsp white miso*
- 1 tsp honey
- 1 tsp rice vinegar
- 2 medium scallions, thinly sliced
- Rice, for serving

## Instructions

1. In a 6(-ish) quart instant pot, combine leeks, bok choy, 1 tbsp butter, salt, and water. Set a small wire rack on top of the leeks and lightly coat with cooking spray. Arrange the fish, skin down, on the rack. Brush the fish with 1 tsp ginger and soy sauce.
2. Lock the lid and close the vent. Set to "steam" and cook for 4 minutes. When time is up, turn off the pot, vent the steam, and remove the lid.
3. While steaming, make the sauce. Stir the honey, miso, vinegar, remaining 1 tsp ginger, and remaining 1 tbsp butter (soften or melt it if necessary) together, until smooth, in a small bowl.
4. Carefully remove fish and rack from instant pot. Spread the miso butter sauce over the fish and cover or contain it to keep warm.
5. Set the instant pot to saute. Cook until the veggies are tender and the remaining liquid in the pot has thickened, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Turn the pot off and serve the veggies over rice, topped with the fish, garnished with scallions.

\*If you cannot find miso, you can substitute it in the sauce with a mixture of gochujang, fish sauce, and chili oil.
