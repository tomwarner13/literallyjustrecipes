## Ingredients
- 2 tbsp unsalted butter
- 3 tbsp AP flour
- 3/4 cup whole milk or even half-and-half for a thicc dip
- 2/3 cup beer[^1]
- 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tsp dijon mustard
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- salt, to taste
- 10 oz (2 1/2 cups) sharp cheddar cheese, shredded

## Instructions

1. Make a roux my melting the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat, then whisking in the flour until it forms a golden-brown, lumpy paste.
2. Whisk in the milk, pouring in a slow and steady stream. Continue whisking until everything is smooth and thick.
3. Whisk in beer, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, garlic powder, paprika, and salt. Continue whisking until everything is incorporated.
4. Whish in the cheese. Once again, continue whisking until it melts smoothly throughout the dip and everything is even.
5. Remove from heat; serve hot or room temperature. Dip pretzels, veggie sticks, crostinis, or thick chips into it.

[^1]: The choice of beer is up to you; it will have a lot of effect on the final flavor. Something like a light lager is standard but you could use an IPA for a hoppy one, or a stout for a dark and rich one, or even get weirder.
