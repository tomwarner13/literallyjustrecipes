## Ingredients

### Crust
- 1 1/4 cup unbleached AP flour
- 1/4 tsp kosher salt
- 1 tsp chopped thyme
- 1 tsp chopped parsley
- 1 tsp chopped savory
- 8 tbsp (1 stick) unsalted butter
- 1/4 cup plain greek yogurt
- 1/4 cup ice cold water
- 2 tsp lemon juice

### Filling

- 1/2 cup goat cheese
- 1/2 cup shredded or crumbled mozarella cheese
- 1/4 cup pesto
- 1/2 lb fresh fiddleheads, trimmed, cleaned of brown bits, rinsed well under cold water
- 1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes
- 1 tsp olive oil
- 1 egg
- Flaky sea salt
- Fresh cracked pepper

## Instructions

1. Add the flour, salt, and herbs to a food processor. Chop the butter into rough cubes and add in. Pulse until mixture resenbles coarse sand.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together yogurt, lemon juice, and water. Add flour mixture and mix with a large spoon or hands until the dough forms a ball. Wrap the ball in plastic wrap and chill in freezer for 20 minutes.
3. Fill a medium pot with water, bring to a boil. Add the rinsed and cleaned fiddleheads and boil hard for 10 minutes *(this is necessary to make them safe to eat)*. Drain in colander.
4. Preheat oven to 400F.
5. Remove the dough from freezer; place on a well-floured surface for rolling. Roll out to a rough circle about 12 inches in diameter.
6. Move the dough onto a baking sheet covered in parchment paper. Spread the pesto evenly across the dough with a spoon, leaving about an inch around the edge. Sprinkle the cheeses on the pesto, and the fiddleheads and sun-dried tomatoes on the cheeses. Drizzle with olive oil.
7. Whisk the egg with 1 tsp water in a small bowl. Fold up the edges of the pastry around the filling. Brush the folded edges with the egg mixture and sprinkle with flaky salt.
8. Add to the oven and bake at 400 for 30 minutes, or until cheese is bubbling and crust is golden brown.
9. Remove from the oven and allow to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes. Transfer on the parchment paper to a wire rack and cool for another 10 or so minutes, until the cheese has set.
10. Cut into slices and serve.
