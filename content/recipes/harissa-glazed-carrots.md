## Ingredients

- 2 lbs whole carrots, washed
- 1/2 cup harissa
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1/4 cup honey
- 1 tbsp coriander
- 1 tbsp cumin
- 1 tbsp smoked paprika
- 1 tbsp dried aleppo pepper
- 1 cup full-fat yogurt
- 1 tsp table salt
- chopped parsley leaves, for garnish

## Instructions

1. Make the labneh: line a colander with cheesecloth or several layers of paper towels, and set it over a bowl to drain. Mix the salt into the yogurt and add the yogurt to the colander. Allow to drain on counter or in refrigerator for at least 3 hours or up to overnight.
2. Make the glaze: mix the harissa, olive oil, honey, coriander, cumin, aleppo, and smoked paprika in a bowl.
3. Preheat oven to 375. Roughly chop the carrots into 3-ish inch pieces; halve or quarter any thick sections so that all the pieces are a similar width.
4. Set a large pot of heavily salted water to boil. When the water boils, add the carrots and parboil for 5 minutes. Remove carrots from water immediately.
5. Divide the glaze in half. When the carrots are cool enough to handle, toss them in half the glaze, coating evenly. Spread the carrots out on a baking pan lined with parchment paper and roast for about 40 minutes, turning once, until carrots are soft and outsides have begun to brown.
6. Shmear the labneh roughly across a large serving tray. Spread the finished carrots on the labneh, and drizzle them with the remaining glaze. Garnish with parsley leaves and serve.
