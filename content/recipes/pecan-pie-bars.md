## Ingredients

### Crust

- 7/8 cups all-purpose flour
- 3/8 cup butter, softened
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 3 tbsp pecans, coarsely chopped

### Filling

- 1/3 cup firmly packed brown sugar
- 3 tbsp all-purpose flour
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 3/4 cup dark corn syrup
- 2 large eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 3/4 cup coarsely chopped pecans
- 1/2 tsp instant espresso or instant coffee

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350.
2. Make the crust. Combine flour, butter and sugar for crust in bowl. Beat at medium speed, scraping often, until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in pecans for crust.
3. Press crust mixture evenly into bottom of ungreased 7x11 baking pan. Bake 18-22 minutes or until edges are very light golden brown. 
4. While crust bakes, make the filling. Combine brown sugar, flour, instant espresso/coffee, and salt in large bowl; whisk until mixed. Add corn syrup, eggs, and vanilla; mix well. Stir in pecans. Spread evenly over hot, partially baked crust. Return to the oven; bake another 30-35 minutes until filling is set and a knife inserted in the bars comes out clean.
5. Allow to cool; refrigerate at least 30 minutes. Optionally, sprinkle with powdered sugar. Cut into bars and serve.
