## Ingredients
- 1 (15 oz) can black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 (15 oz) can kidney beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 (15 oz) can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 (15 oz) can corn, drained and rinsed
- 1/2 large green bell pepper, chopped
- 1/2 large red bell pepper, chopped
- 1/2 large red onion, chopped
- 1/4 cup cilantro, chopped
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1/4 cup red wine vinegar
- 1 tbsp fresh lime juice
- 1 tbsp fresh lemon juice
- 1 tbsp granulated sugar
- 1/2 tbsp salt
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 tbsp ground cumin
- 1/4 tsp chili powder
- black pepper, to taste
- 1 large avocado

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, combine beans, corn, peppers, onion, and cilantro. You may want to consider combining them in a colander first and letting it drain into your sink for a couple minutes.
2. In a small bowl, whisk together oil, vinegar, lime and lemon juices, sugar, salt, garlic, cumin, chili powder, a splash of hot sauce (optional), and black pepper.
3. Pour the dressing over the combined salad ingredients in the bowl. Mix well and refrigerate, covered, ideally for at least 3-4 hours before serving so flavors can mingle.
4. Dice and mix the avocado into the salad directly before serving.
