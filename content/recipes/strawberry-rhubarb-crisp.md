## Ingredients
- Cooking spray
- 1/2 cup turbinado sugar
- 3/4 cup old-fashioned oats
- 1/2 cup AP flour
- 1/2 cup finely chopped pecans
- Pinch salt
- 1/2 cup cold unsalted butter
- 1 lb rhubarb stalks
- 1 lb strawberries
- 1/4 cup cornstarch
- 1/2 cup white sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 orange
- Vanilla ice cream, for serving

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350. Spray a 3qt (9x13) baking dish with cooking spray; if you have to use a smaller dish the crumble may bubble over, so use a baking sheet below it in the oven to catch any drips. 
2. In a medium bowl, add the turbinado sugar, oats, flour, pecans, and salt. Cut the butter into small pieces and stir into dry ingredients. Press together to form chunks. Freeze 10-15 minutes.
3. While the crumble freezes, halve the rhubarb sticks if they are especially thick, and cut them into inch-long segments. Hull and half the strawberries; quarter any large ones. In a large bowl, combine rhubarb, strawberries, white sugar, cornstarch, and vanilla. Zest the orange into the mixture, then juice half of it into the bowl as well.
4. Pour filling mixture into baking dish. Top with the crumble mixture, keeping large chunks intact. Bake until golden brown, about 40-50 minutes. Let cool on a counter for a few minutes. Serve warm with ice cream.
