## Ingredients
- Cooking spray
- 1 cup sugar, divided
- 3/4 cup old-fashioned oats
- 1/2 cup AP flour
- 1/2 cup finely chopped pecans
- Pinch salt
- 1/2 cup cold unsalted butter
- 1 lb rhubarb stalks
- 1 lb strawberries
- 1/4 cup cornstarch
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- Vanilla ice cream, for serving

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350. Spray an 8x8 baking dish with cooking spray. In a medium bowl, add 1/2 cup of the sugar, oats, flour, pecans, and salt. Cut the butter into small pieces and stir into dry ingredients. Press together to form chunks. Freeze 10-15 minutes.
2. While the crumble freezes, halve the rhubarb sticks if they are especially thick, and cut them into inch-long segments. Hull and half the strawberries; quarter any large ones. In a large bowl, combin rhubarb, strawberries, remaining sugar, cornstarch, and vanilla. Zest the orange into the mixture, then juice half of it into the bowl as well.
3. Pour filling mixture into baking dish. Top with the crumble mixture, keeping large chunks intact. Bake until golden brown, about 40-50 minutes. Let cool on a counter for a few minutes. Serve warm with ice cream.
