## Ingredients
- 12 Hawaiian rolls (King's, for example)
- 1 (3.4 oz) box instant vanilla pudding mix
- 1 cup cold milk
- 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
- 1/2 cup chocolate frosting

## Instructions

1. In a medium mixing bowl, combine vanilla pudding mix with cold milk, stirring to whisk out any lumps, then set aside to thicken for 5 minutes.
2. Whip heavy whipping cream to form stiff peaks, then fold the whipped cream into the thickened vanilla pudding.
3. Transfer the vanilla pudding mixture into a piping bag or Ziploc bag and set aside.
4. Separate the hawaiian rolls from each other, then use your finger or the handle of a utensil to punch a hole into the side of each roll. Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
5. Cut off one end of the vanilla pudding bag, then generously fill each hawaiian roll with the creamy custard mix.
6. Warm 1/2 cup chocolate frosting in the microwave to soften, no need to go too hot here, then dip the top of each filled roll and place on the sheet to set for 12 seconds, or as long as you can keep people away from them.

Makes 12 rolls.
