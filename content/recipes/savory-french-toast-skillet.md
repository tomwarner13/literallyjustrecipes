## Ingredients

- 10 eggs
- 1 loaf herbal focaccia
- 2 cups milk
- 1 cup chopped spinach (fresh or frozen)
- 1/2 cup basil
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp red pepper flakes
- 1 tsp thyme
- 1 tsp oregano
- ground black pepper,  to taste 
- 2 oz grated Romano cheese
- 2 tbsp butter
- 1 oz grated Parmesan cheese
- flaky sea salt, to taste
- Chopped parsley for garnish

## Instructions

1. Cube the focaccia and allow the cubes to dry out, overnight or over up to several days.
2. In a large bowl, beat together the eggs, spinach, basil, garlic, herbs, red pepper, black pepper, and Romano cheese. Pour over the dried focaccia cubes and allow to soak for at least 30 minutes or up to overnight.
3. Preheat oven to 350F.
4. Preheat an oven-safe cast iron skillet on the stove over medium heat. Add the butter to the skillet and allow to melt and coat the bottom of the skillet.
5. Pour the egg and bread mixture into the heated, greased skillet. Top with the Parmesan and flaky salt to taste.
6. Place the skillet in the oven and bake for 30-40 minutes until the top is golden brown and a fork inserted in the middle comes out clean.
7. Garnish with parsley and serve hot with any sweet and savory sauces.

\* Adjustments: chopped, precooked bacon or breakfast sausage, roasted veggies like tomatoes, onion, mushrooms,  or peppers, or any other fresh herbs or cheeses you have available would all be great additions. I normally throw in a few dashes of a nice hot sauce as well--not enough to overpower the flavors but enough to add some zip.
