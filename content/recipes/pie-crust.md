## Ingredients
- 1.5 cups AP flour
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp sugar[^1]
- 3 tbsp vegatable shortening
- 6 tbsp cold unsalted butter
- Ice water (you'll probably need half a cup at most)

## Instructions

1. With a cold knife on a cold cutting board (as much as feasible), chop the butter into rough squares; maybe half a tbsp each. Keep cold if necessary; you want it to form big lumps in the dough and the colder it is, the more it'll stay together. If it's especially warm in your kitchen, or (for example) your hands are constanly radiating intense heat, you may even want to consider pre-chilling other ingredients or equipment, like flour or the food processor bowl.
2. In a food processor, add the flour, salt, and sugar (if using). Pulse a few times to mix.
3. Add the butter and shortening. Pulse until the butter chunks are roughly the size of peas.
4. With the machine running on low, pour the ice water down the feed tube, a tablespoon at a time, until the dough begins to form a ball.
5. Place the dough on a floured surface and roll it quickly to a rough hockey-puck shape. Wrap the puck in plastic wrap and refrigerate or freeze immediately; freeze for 15 minutes if you're in a hurry or refrigerate for at least 30 if you're not.
6. After the dough has chilled, roll it out into the shape you need. As before, you may want to refrigerate or even freeze your rolling surface or rolling pin.

Makes one standard size (~9inch pan) pie crust; double the recipe if your pie calls for a top and bottom crust.

[^1]: Omit the sugar if you are making a savory pie, like a quiche or a meat pie.
