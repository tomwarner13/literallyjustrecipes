## Ingredients
- 1 stick (1/2 cup) butter, chopped roughly
- 2 cups granulated white sugar
- 1/2 cup milk, ideally whole
- 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 3 cups instant oats

## Instructions

1. Combine butter, sugar, milk, and cocoa powder in a large saucepan. Heat over medium heat, stirring regularly.
2. While the mixture heats, line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside.
3. When the mixture in the saucepan reaches a rolling boil, set a timer to 1 minute. Leave at a rolling boil for the minute, then remove from heat.
4. Stir in peanut butter and vanilla extract to the hot mixture until fully incorporated. Stir in the oats and mix until everything is evenly combined.
5. With a large spoon or cookie scoop, dollop the mixture onto the prepared baking sheets. Don't worry too much about leaving separation between the cookies because they won't spread far.
6. Leave the cookies on the baking sheets to cool and set for 20 to 30 minutes at room temperature. You can now serve them, or store them for later.
