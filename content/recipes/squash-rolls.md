## Ingredients
- 1 tbsp active dry yeast
- 1/4 cup warm water (110-115 F)
- 1 tsp sugar
- 2/3 cup warm milk (110-115 F)
- 1 cup mashed cooked butternut squash, room temp
- 1 egg
- 1/3 cup butter, melted
- 1/4 cup packed brown sugar
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 cups whole wheat flour
- 2 to 2 1/2 cups AP flour

## Instructions

1. In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Stir in sugar and let sit 5 minutes, or until yeast starts to activate.
2. Stir in milk, squash, brown sugar, egg, and salt.
3. Add whole wheat flour and beat at medium speed for 2 minutes. Stir in just enough of the AP flour to form a soft, delicate dough.
4. Turn dough onto a floured surface, knead lightly until smooth and just elastic, about 10 minutes. Place in oiled bowl, turning once to evenly coat. Cover and proof in a warm place until roughly doubled, about 1 hour.
5. Punch dough down and turn onto a floured surface; divide into ~20 pieces. Shape each piece into a ball. Place ~2 inches apart on baking sheet(s) coated with cooking spray. Cover and let rise in a warm place until about doubled, about 45 minutes. Preheat oven to 400 when getting ready to bake.
6. Bake a 400 for 11-13 minutes or until golden brown. Remove and cool on wire racks. Serve with butter.

Makes about 20 rolls.
