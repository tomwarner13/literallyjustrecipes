## Ingredients
- 1 1/2 lbs chicken thighs
- Kosher salt
- Ground black pepper
- 1 tbsp. [Ras el Hanout](/recipes/ras-el-hanout/)
- 2 Tbsp. EVOO, divided
- 1 small shallot, finely chopped
- 8 oz. baby bella mushrooms, washed and thinly sliced 
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1/2 cup harissa
- 2 tsp. fresh thyme leaves, finely chopped 
- 1 cup chicken broth 
- 1 1/4 cups half-and-half
- 1 (17-oz.) pkg. dry or frozen gnocchi
- 3/4 cup crumbled goat cheese, divided 
- 3 cups packed baby spinach
- 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh basil leaves

## Instructions

1. Flatten out chicken thighs and season heavily with Ras el Hanout, salt, and pepper. Heat 1 tbsp EVOO to a large (at least-12-inch) skillet and heat on medium-high until shimmering. Add chicken thighs and sear hard, turning once, until both sides are browned, about 2 minutes per side. Remove chicken and set aside.
2. Add remaining tablespoon of EVOO to the hot skillet and add the mushrooms and chopped shallot. Saute, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms are starting to brown all around, about 6 minutes.
3. Add harissa, garlic, and thyme to the skillet and cook, stirring often, until fragrant, 2 minutes at most. Stir in chicken broth and deglaze the bottom of the skillet.
4. Slowly stir in half-and-half to the skillet until fully incorporated. Bring to a simmer and stir in the gnocchi.
5. Hold at a low simmer, stirring occasionaly, until gnocchi starts to become tender, 10 minutes at most.
6. While the gnocchi cooks, dice the seared chicken. Stir it back into the skillet along with any juices.
7. Stir in 1/2 cup of the goat cheese, then add the spinach. Gradually stir it into the sauce as it wilts, for roughly 3 minutes.
8. Remove from heat and sprinke with remaining goat cheese and basil leaves. Spoon into bowls and serve.

Makes roughly 6 servings.
