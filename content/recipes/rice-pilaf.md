## Ingredients
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 large shallot, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 cup orzo (arborio works as a substitute)
- 1 cup long grain white rice
- 3 cups veggie or chicken stock
- 1 tsp coriander
- 1 tsp paprika
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 cup fresh parsley, chopped, for garnish

## Instructions

1. In a large skillet or pan, heat 1 tbsp olive oil on medium. Add onion and saute for 90 seconds until fragrant.
2. Add orzo and minced garlic. Saute for 3 minutes, stirring often.
3. Add remaining 1 tbsp olive oil. Stir in rice. Continue to toast for 4 to 5 minutes until rice and orzo are translucent.
4. Add all seasonings to rice, stir to combine. Stir in stock. Cover. Turn up heat and bring to a boil, then turn down to medium-low to simmer.
5. Simmer, covered, for 15 minutes until liquid is absorbed in rice. Do not remove cover or stir.
6. Remove from heat. Keep the cover on the rice to allow it to absorb steam for 3 minutes.
7. Uncover and fluff rice with a fork. Garnish with parsley and serve.
