## Ingredients
- 1 (14oz) can artichoke hearts, drained and finely minced
- 4 cups fresh spinach
- 1 bar (8oz) cream cheese, softened at room temperature
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided
- 1/2 cup mayonnaise
- 1/2 cup Greek yogurt or sour cream
- 1 tsp red pepper flakes (or to taste)
- Salt and pepper, to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375.
2. Spread the spinach out on a gently oiled baking sheet. Bake for roughly 6 minutes, watching closely, until just crispy.
3. In a large bowl, mix all ingredients together except for 1/4 cup of the Parmesan cheese and a large pinch of the baked spinach.
4. Spread the dip mix smoothly across the bottom of a large (roughly 8x8) baking dish.
5. Sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan across the dip. Crumble the remaining baked spinach on top.
6. Bake approximately 20 minutes until cheese is melted on top and dip is bubbling.
7. Serve hot with pita chips, bread, or veggies for dipping.

Makes approximately 10 servings.
