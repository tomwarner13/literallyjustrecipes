## Ingredients

- 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 tsp paprika
- 1 tsp red pepper flakes, or to spice tolerances
- 8 large eggs
- 3/4 cup whole milk
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh thyme
- 2 tablespoons minced chives, parsley and/or tarragon
- 1 tbsp dried savory
- 1/2 cup fresh or frozen spinach, and/or chopped basil
- Any spicy and/or savory sauces, for serving
- Lemon wedges, for serving

## Instructions

1. Heat oven to 425 degrees. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, salt, pepper, paprika, pepper flakes and dried herbs. In a separate bowl, whisk together eggs and milk. Whisk wet ingredients into dry until just combined. Stir in spinach/basil and any remaining herbs to form a consistent batter.
2. Melt the butter in a heavy 12-inch ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Let it cook until it just smells nutty and browns, about 5 to 7 minutes, then swirl skillet so that butter coats bottom of pan.
3. Pour batter into pan and scatter cheese and flaky salt over the top (be careful not to oversalt, especially if the cheese is already salty). Bake until puffed and golden, about 25 minutes. Serve with savory sauces and lemon wedges on the side.

* Variations: just about anything you can imagine would be good in here. Use whatever good herbs and/or cheese you have lying around. Throw some minced garlic and/or shallots in the butter when it's almost browned and sautee them till fragrant, then pour in the batter and mix well. If you want to go meatier, crumbled, pre-cooked bacon or sausage would be a great mix-in. If you want to go veg, sun-dried tomatoes or sauteed peppers or onions or whatever other veggies your heart desires.
