## Ingredients

- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter
- 8 oz cream cheese
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh sage
- 1 tbsp chopped savory, fresh or dried
- 2 large shallots, finely chopped
- 1/4 tsp aleppo or chili flakes
- 1 cup pure pumpkin puree
- 2 pinches kosher salt
- 1 pinch black pepper
- 1/2 cup walnuts finely chopped
- 1 egg
- 1 tsp water
- flakey salt and/or finely shredded parmesan cheese for sprinkling

## Instructions

1. Make the dough: Cut the butter and cream cheese into ~tbsp sized pats and let soften for ~15m. Pulse flour and salt in food processer, then add butter and cream cheese and pulse several times, until the mixture has formed large crumbly chunks. Gather the dough into 2 large balls, flatten into disks and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours, up to overnight.
2. Make the filling: Head 3tbsp EVOO in large skillet until shimmering. Add shallots, sage, savory, and pepper flakes and cook until fragrant (~2min). Stir in the pumpkin puree and cook ~5m more to reduce water. Season with kosher salt and black pepper. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature. 
3. Preheat oven to 350. Roll each dough disk into a 12" circle on floured surface. Use lots of flour under it to avoid sticking. Mix the chopped walnuts into the filling, then spread half of the filling onto each disk. Cut each disk into 16 triangles. Roll each one starting from the wide end to form a crescent. Place on cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.
4. Beat the egg with 1 tsp water and brush lightly on each rugelach. Top each with flaky sea salt and/or grated parmesan. Bake for ~27m until golden brown. Serve warm if possible. Makes 32 small rugelach.
