## Ingredients
- 2 cups chopped spinach or kale
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 2 large avocados
- 1 fresno or jalapeno pepper, minced
- 2 cloves garlic
- 2 tbsp lemon juice, ideally fresh
- 1 tbsp hot sauce
- pinch salt
- pinch black pepper
- pinch chili flakes
- 3 oz smoked Gouda cheese, shredded
- 3 oz Monterey Jack cheese, shredded
- 1 oz crumbled goat cheese (or another soft cheese, such as Brie)
- 1 oz shredded Parmesan cheese
- Pita chips, for serving

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375. Roughly chop the spinach or kale and remove any large stems. Brush olive oil on a baking sheet and scatter the leafy greens and hot pepper evenly across it.
2. Cook in the oven for 3-5 minutes (2-3 if using convection) until the greens are crispy and the pepper is softened. Remove from oven and heat to 400.
3. While the greens are cooking, peel and pit the avocados. Place them in the bowl of a food processor. Add garlic, lemon juice, hot sauce, and all seasonings. Add the minced hot pepper and greens once they're out of the oven. Add the Parmesan and goat cheeses, and half of the Gouda and Monterey Jack.
4. Pulse in the food processor until everything is well mixed. You'll probably have to scrape the sides a few times.
5. Empty the dip from the food processor into a 1 quart baking dish. Roughly flatten and smooth the dip, then place the dish in the oven.
6. Bake at 400 for 12-16 minutes (9-12 if using convection) until the dip begins to bubble.
7. Remove the dip from the oven. Set the oven to broil on High. Scatter remaining shredded cheese evenly across the top of the dip.
8. Broil for 2-5 minutes until cheese starts to bubble and brown on top.
9. Remove from oven and serve hot with pita chips.

Makes roughly 3 cups of dip.
