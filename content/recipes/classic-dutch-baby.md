## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup whole milk
- 1 tbsp sugar (I normally use light brown)
- 3 eggs
- 4 tbsp unsalted butter
- pinch fine salt
- pinch cinammon
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/4 cup blueberries (optional)
- 1/4 cup chocolate chips (optional)
- powdered sugar, for garnish
- maple syrup, for serving

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Heat a cast-iron skillet in the oven while it preheats, until piping hot.
2. In a blender, combine flour, milk, sugar, eggs, 3 tbsp of melted butter, salt, and seasonings. Blend until batter is fully mixed and frothy.
3. Remove skillet from oven and immediately melt the remaining 1 tbsp butter in it, stirring or swirling to coat the entire surface. If using chocolate chips and/or blueberries, mix them into the batter, and then pour batter into skillet.
4. Return the skillet to the oven and bake for 18 to 20 minutes, until puffed up and golden brown on top.
5. Remove from oven and dust with powdered sugar. Cut into wedges and serve hot out the skillet with butter, maple syrup, fruit jams, and/or lemon wedges.
