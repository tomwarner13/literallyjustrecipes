## Ingredients

- 8 oz (1 bar) cream cheese, softened at room temperature
- 1/2 cup hot sauce [^1]
- 1/2 cup ranch dressing
- 2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese
- 1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese
- 1/2 lb cooked boneless, skinless chicken breast [^2]
- 1/2 a small white onion, finely minced (optional)
- 1 stalk celery, finely minced (optional)
- 1/4 cup sliced green onions

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. If using onion/celery, add a drizzle of olive oil to a frying pan and heat it to medium-high. When the oil shimmers, add the minced veggies and saute aggressively until they start to brown. Remove from heat and set veggies aside in a small bowl.
3. Finely dice the cooked chicken. Cutting it into small, even pieces ensures that it will be evenly distributed in every scoop of dip.
4. In a medium bowl, mix together the cream cheese, hot sauce, ranch dressing, 1 cup of the cheddar, 1/4 cup of the blue cheese crumbles, sauteed onion/celery if using, and diced chicken until evenly combined.
5. Spread chicken mixture in a 1-quart (8x6) baking dish. Sprinkle remaining shredded cheddar in a layer on top.
6. Once oven is preheated, bake 20-25 minutes, until cheese on top is bubbling. Remove from oven.
7. Top with remaining blue cheese crumbles and green onions. Serve with hot crostini, pita chips, hearty crackers, or sliced veggies.

[^1]: You can use just about any hot sauce you like here, but be mindful that half a cup is a lot of sauce and an aggressively spicy sauce will make an aggressively spicy dip. Personally I try to use a good-quality buffalo-style hot sauce. Just DO NOT use a pre-made "wing" sauce because it will be full of cheap fats (butter substitutes like soybean oil) that will make your dip oily and unpleasant.
[^2]: You can use pre-cooked chicken for this, or bake your own-for an 8oz chicken breast you can toss it in salt and olive oil and bake it for about 18 minutes at 425; just confirm the internal temperature is at least 165 when it's finished (or slice through it and confirm there's no pink left in the meat).
