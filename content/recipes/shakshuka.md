## Ingredients

### Shakshuka
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 medium yellow onion, roughly diced
- 1 medium red or orange bell pepper, chopped
- 1 (or more) fresno, serrano, or other spicy peppers, finely chopped, to spice tolerance(s)
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp aleppo or other spicy chili flakes, to spice tolerance(s)
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 tsp salt
- pinch black pepper, to taste
- 3 tbsp tomato paste
- 4 medium roma tomatoes, roughly chopped
- 8 eggs

### Sauce and serving

- 1/2 cup tahini
- 1/4 cup lemon juice (ideally fresh squeezed)
- salt
- crumbled feta cheese, for serving
- chopped parsley, for serving
- 4 warm pita bread rounds 

## Instructions

1. In a large skillet, heat the oil. Add the onion and chopped peppers and cook until pepper is soft and onion is translucent.
2. Add garlic and seasonings; cook until garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds.
3. Add tomato paste and chopped tomatoes, stir to thoroughly mix. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer roughly 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes have softened and the mixture resembles a chunky tomato sauce.
4. While the shakshuka simmers, make the sauce. Mix the lemon juice, tahini, and a pinch of fine salt together in a bowl until fully combined and smooth. If mixture is too thick, stir in more lemon juice or water, a spoonful at a time.
5. Using a spoon, make a little nest for each egg in the tomato mixture. Crack each egg into its nest. Cover and continue to simmer until egg whites have all, just, thoroughly cooked (you want your yolks still runny).
6. Garnish the shakshuka with chopped parsley and serve by spooning into/onto warm pitas and topping with the lemon tahini sauce and crumbly feta.
