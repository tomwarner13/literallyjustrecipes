## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 lbs small potatoes: red, Yukon gold, or some of each - DO NOT PEEL
- Vegetable or avocado oil

### Seasoning mix:
- 1 tbsp cornstarch
- 1 tsp kosher salt
- 1/2 tsp onion powder
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/4 tsp smoked paprika

### Sauce:
- 1/2 cup mayo
- 2 tbsp buttermilk, sour cream, or plain yogurt
- sriracha or other hot sauce, to taste
- chili sauce, tomato jam, or, if desperate, ketchup to taste
- Thai chili oil, to taste

## Instructions

1. About an hour before you're ready to cook: rinse and/ or scrub the potatoes and let them drain, then spread out so they dry completely.
2. When ready to cook, halve or quarter the potatoes to get to bite sized pieces. Preheat oven to 450 and have a large sheet tray ready.
3. Toss the seasoning mix together in a small bowl. Feel free to boost the amounts of seasoning a little, but stick with the 1 tbsp cornstarch.
4. Pour about a tablespoon of oil into a large bowl. Add the potatoes, then a little more oil over the top, and toss together - you just want a thin coating of oil on all the potatoes; there should NOT be a pool of oil left in the bottom of the bowl. When they're all coated, sprinkle on the seasoning mix. Toss very thoroughly to coat all the pieces with the seasoning.
5. Dump onto the sheet tray and pop into the 450 oven. Bake for 20 minutes without opening the door - check, then stir, after 20 minutes - perhaps they will need 5 more minutes but perhaps not.
6. While the potatoes are baking, OR well ahead of time, stir together the sauce ingredients. You really can use a variety of condiments as long as you get creamy, tangy, hot, and sweet, all in there. 
7. When the potatoes are done, serve with the sauce either drizzled over, or on the side. We prefer on the side, so that the potatoes retain their crispiness.
